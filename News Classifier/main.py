	* TF-IDF Vectors as features  [Chossing this easy one]
	* Word Embeddings as features
	* Text / NLP based features
	* Topic Models as features


	We have to define the different parameters:

	* `ngram_range`: We want to consider both unigrams and bigrams.
	* `max_df`: When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
	    frequency strictly higher than the given threshold
	* `min_df`: When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
	    frequency strictly lower than the given threshold.
	* `max_features`: If not None, build a vocabulary that only consider the top
	    max_features ordered by term frequency across the corpus.

## Building the model

'''
Once we have our feature vectors built, we'll try several machine learning classification models
in order to find which one performs best on our data. We will try with the following models:

* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes
* Multinomial Logistic Regression
* Gradient Boosting

The methodology used to train each model is as follows:

1. First of all, we'll decide which hyperparameters we want to tune.

2. Secondly, we'll define the metric we'll get when measuring the performance of 
a model. In this case, we'll use the **accuracy**.

3. We'll perform a Randomized Search Cross Validation process in order to find 
the hyperparameter region in which we get higher values of accuracy.

4. Once we find that region, we'll use a Grid Search Cross Validation process to 
exhaustively find the best combination of hyperparameters.

5. Once we obtain the best combination of hyperparameters, we'll obtain the accuracy on 
the training data and the test data, the classification report and the confusion matrix.

6. Finally, we'll calculate the accuracy of a model with default hyperparameters, 
to see if we have achieved better results by hyperparameter tuning.

We need to be aware of the fact that our dataset only contains 5 categories:

* Business
* Politics
* Sports
* Tech
* Entertainment

So, when we get news articles that don't belong to any of that categories (for example, weather or 
terrorism news articles), we will surely get a wrong prediction. For this reason we will take into 
account the conditional probability of belonging to every class and set a lower threshold (i.e. if 
the 5 conditional probabilities are lower than 65% then the prediction will be 'other'). This 
probability vector can be obtained in a simple way in some models, but not in other ones. For this
reason we will take this into consideration when choosing the model to use.

Spainâs animal rights party PACMA posted a 38-second video on Twitter on Friday showing a man freeing a fox from a cage, before hunters immediately start shooting at it.

âHunters shut what appears to be a fox in a cage and let it out only to pepper it with bullets,â says the accompanying text. âAnother âisolated caseâ as the hunting lobby refers to it. Every week, a trickle of âisolated cases.â In fact, they are dangerous psychopaths with a rifle and a license to carry arms.â

 Cazadores enjaulan a lo que parece ser un zorro y lo liberan solo para acribillarlo a tiros. Otro "caso aislado", de los que habla el lobby de la caza. Cada semana varios "casos aislados".

En realidad, son peligrosos psicÃ³patas con escopeta y permiso de amas. #YoNoDisparo

At the start of the video, a man teases the caged animal with a stick. When the cage door is opened, the animal makes a run for it, but is shot at by men armed with rifles who are waiting by the cage.

The release of the video, which has had 255,000 views, coincided with the launch of PACMAâs campaign against the start of fox-hunting season in Galicia. âFox-hunting season in Galicia has started: hunts that hide behind environmental excuses, championships in which the only reason to compete is to kill. The hunters will be entitled to pursue and kill thousands of foxes in the countryside,â states PACMA.

As it notes on its website, PACMA is the only political group that opposes hunting, and it is currently demanding a nationwide ban. âNo animal should die under fire,â say the group. âWe will fight tirelessly until hunting becomes a crime.â

No animal should die under fire. We will fight tirelessly until hunting becomes a crime

PACMA

The animal rights group is preparing a report to send to the regional government of Galicia against fox hunts. âWe are working hard to make it the first Spanish region to assign resources to protecting foxes instead of killing them,â says a source at PACMA.

Last month, a Spanish hunter who was filmed while he chased and tortured a fox was identified by the Civil Guard in the Spanish province of Huesca. The man, aged 35, is facing charges of crimes against wildlife.

And in November, animal rights groups and political parties reacted with indignation over a viral video shot in CÃ¡ceres province of 12 hunting dogs falling off a cliff edge, followed by the deer they were attacking.

# d = ['''A corpus may contain texts in a single language (monolingual corpus) or text data in multiple languages (multilingual corpus).

# Multilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side-by-side comparison are called aligned parallel corpora. There are two main types of parallel corpora which contain texts in two languages. In a translation corpus, the texts in one language are translations of texts in the other language. In a comparable corpus, the texts are of the same kind and cover the same content, but they are not translations of each other.[1] To exploit a parallel text, some kind of text alignment identifying equivalent text segments (phrases or sentences) is a prerequisite for analysis. Machine translation algorithms for translating between two languages are often trained using parallel fragments comprising a first language corpus and a second language corpus which is an element-for-element translation of the first language corpus.[2]

# In order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research, they are often subjected to a process known as annotation. An example of annotating a corpus is part-of-speech tagging, or POS-tagging, in which information about each word's part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of tags. Another example is indicating the lemma (base) form of each word. When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it, interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual.

# Some corpora have further structured levels of analysis applied. In particular, a number of smaller corpora may be fully parsed. Such corpora are usually called Treebanks or Parsed Corpora. The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller, containing around one to three million words. Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible, including annotations for morphology, semantics and pragmatics.

# Corpora are the main knowledge base in corpus linguistics. The analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in computational linguistics, speech recognition and machine translation, where they are often used to create hidden Markov models for part of speech tagging and other purposes. Corpora and frequency lists derived from them are useful for language teaching. Corpora can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non-native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language, enabling effective writing''']
